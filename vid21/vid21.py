# PATH environment
# the PATH is a list of directories that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files

# in Linux
# env shows all the current environmental variables
# env | grep PATH shows only the PATH alone
# echo $PATH shows the contents of just the PATH alone

# PATH can be changed just for the current login session
# PATH="/usr/sbin:$PATH"
# or permanently
# bit editing .bash_profile file
# .bash_profile is a hidden in a linux user's home directory

# probably best to use the ~/.bashrc
